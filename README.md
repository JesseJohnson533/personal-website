# personal-website

## About

This project is a responsive personal website built with a Python Flask backend and designed using JavaScript, Bootstrap HTML, and Sass CSS to showcase my professional portfolio, skills, and contact information. Developed in a Docker container and deployed to production via Heroku, the site features a Project Portfolio highlighting my work, direct links to my GitHub and LinkedIn, a downloadable Resume, and a Contact Me section with a form for easy communication. It serves as a centralized, polished platform to present my professional identity and connect with potential collaborators or employers.
